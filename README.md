## About
Hello! I am Zhengxin"Jason" Wang, a Ph.D. in Statistics from Clemson University graduated in May 2024. My academic journey has equipped me with strong programming and data analytical skills.

I am currently working at DuBu Research as a Biostatistician with responsibility for protocol development, Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs) writing, SDTM/ADaM preparation, statistical analysis for clinical trials, tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) creation, and Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) writing.

## Research
### Bayesian Modeling for fMRI Data Analysis
[Publication](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1iq%7Ep,GdM5rVvP)
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06348)

- Developed Bayesian spatiotemporal models for task-based complex-valued fMRI brain signals. Implemented parallel computation and MCMC algorithms in R and C++ to identify active brain voxels.
- Achieved an 87% reduction in computational time and a 9.5% increase in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.
- Pioneered phase mapping using a fully Bayesian approach.

### Machine Learning for LLM Science Exam Analysis

- Trained a model based on the deberta-v3-large, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Achieved a 0.904 accuracy rate in answering complex science questions written by a Large Language Model.
- Won a silver medal in the Kaggle LLM Science-Based Question-Answering Competition, ranking 103rd out of 2,662 teams.

### Time Series and Bias Analysis in Swimming Speed
[Publication](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jqas-2019-0087/html)

- Quantified the high-tech swimsuit bias in men's swimming events and restored true records in their absence by applying the ARIMA time series model, smoothing splines, and bootstrap methods.
- Achieved less than 1.3% percentage error compared to the top times recorded since the ban on high-tech swimsuits.

### Statistical Modeling for Pore Size Distribution
[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967314007833)
[Publication](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/btpr.2013)

- Formulated Gaussian and log-normal models to analyze the pore size distribution in C-CP fiber stationary phases for chromatography.
- This foundational work underpinned subsequent research, contributing to over 50 peer-reviewed scholarly articles.
