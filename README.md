## About
Hello! I am Zhengxin"Jason" Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Clemson University, expecting to graduate in May 2024. My research focuses on medical image analysis, employing a combination of statistical modeling and machine/deep learning methodologies. My academic journey has equipped me with strong programming and data analytical skills. I am currently aspiring to a career in data science or machine learning, where I can apply these skills to contribute to finding solutions to big, difficult, and impactful problems.

In addition to my statistical expertise, I hold a Master's degree in Analytical Chemistry, which has provided me with foundational knowledge and practical experience in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and medical imaging techniques such as fMRI, PET, and EEG. This diverse skill set offers me a distinct edge, particularly in opportunities within the healthcare or pharmaceutical industries, while I remain open to exploring a wide range of roles where my comprehensive expertise can be applied effectively

## Research
### Bayesian Modeling for fMRI Data Analysis
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18536)
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06348)

- Developed Bayesian spatiotemporal models for task-based complex-valued fMRI brain signals. Implemented parallel computation and MCMC algorithms in R and C++ to identify active brain voxels.
- Achieved an 87% reduction in computational time and a 9.5% increase in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.
- Pioneered phase mapping using a fully Bayesian approach.

### Machine Learning for LLM Science Exam Analysis

- Trained a model based on the deberta-v3-large, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Achieved a 0.904 accuracy rate in answering complex science questions written by a Large Language Model.
- Won a silver medal in the Kaggle LLM Science-Based Question-Answering Competition, ranking 103rd out of 2,662 teams.

### Time Series and Bias Analysis in Swimming Speed
[Publication](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jqas-2019-0087/html)

- Quantified the high-tech swimsuit bias in men's swimming events and restored true records in their absence by applying the ARIMA time series model, smoothing splines, and bootstrap methods.
- Achieved less than 1.3% percentage error compared to the top times recorded since the ban on high-tech swimsuits.
